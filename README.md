How do seasons, rider types, and hours of the day affect revenue & profit?

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL Server → Data cleaning, transformations, and queries.

Power BI → Dashboard building, KPIs, and storytelling.

📊 Key Insights

Peak income occurs between 10 AM – 3 PM.

Summer season generates the highest revenue.

Rider types contribute equally in count, but revenue distribution differs.

Monthly trends show steady rider growth with slight profit fluctuations.
